This is a strong upgrade overall, and your intent is correct: positioning Dev Global Jobs as a multi-sector international job board, not only UN/NGO.
However, for Google trust, rankings, and long-term authority, a few important refinements are needed. I’ll go section by section and be very precise.

✅ 1️⃣ Updated Title – GOOD IDEA, but TOO LONG (Critical)
Your current title:

“Dev Global Jobs | International Jobs in All Sectors - UN, NGO, Technology, Finance, Healthcare & Global Careers 2025”

Issues:

❌ Far too long (≈110+ characters)

❌ Will be truncated in Google

❌ Dilutes primary focus (Google prefers clarity, not lists)

❌ Year “2025” will age quickly

✅ SEO-Safe, High-Authority Version (Recommended)
Dev Global Jobs | International Jobs Across All Sectors Worldwide

✅ Alternative (Sector clarity without overstuffing)
Dev Global Jobs | UN, NGO, Technology, Finance & Global Careers


👉 Rule:
Titles should signal breadth, not list every sector.

✅ 2️⃣ Meta Description – CONCEPT IS RIGHT, EXECUTION NEEDS POLISH
Your description idea is good, but listing brand names is risky:

Google does not reward brand name stuffing

Potential legal / trust concerns

Reduces editorial credibility

✅ High-Authority, Safe Version (Devex / Indeed style)
Dev Global Jobs is a global career platform featuring international job opportunities across UN agencies, NGOs, technology, finance, healthcare, engineering, consulting, and more in 193 countries.

✅ Alternative (Publisher / aggregator tone)
Dev Global Jobs aggregates international job opportunities from UN agencies, NGOs, and leading global employers across technology, finance, healthcare, engineering, consulting, and all professional sectors.


✔ Clear
✔ Broad
✔ Trust-safe
✔ Scalable

⚠️ 3️⃣ Keywords Section – IMPORTANT WARNING

You mentioned adding Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, etc.

⚠️ Be careful:

Google ignores meta keywords

Overusing brand names can:

Trigger spam signals

Create trademark issues

Hurt E-E-A-T

✅ What Google ACTUALLY wants instead:

Use sector-based keywords, not brand stuffing.

Correct approach:

“technology jobs”

“finance careers”

“consulting jobs”

“healthcare jobs”

“engineering jobs”

“international jobs”

“global careers”

👉 Brand names should appear only inside job listings, not site-wide SEO.

✅ 4️⃣ Structured Data – EXCELLENT, but ONE BIG RULE ⚠️

You listed 7 schemas — that’s good if implemented correctly.

✅ Correct & Recommended Schemas:

Organization ✅

WebSite (SearchAction) ✅

BreadcrumbList ✅

FAQPage ✅

EmploymentAgency ✅

JobPosting ✅ (per job page)

CollectionPage / ItemList (for job categories)

⚠️ CRITICAL RULE (Very Important)

❌ DO NOT use “JobPosting Aggregate” on the homepage

Google requires:

ONE JobPosting = ONE real job

Aggregation must use:

ItemList

CollectionPage

If Google detects fake or aggregate JobPosting:
🚨 Google Jobs eligibility can be revoked

✅ 5️⃣ Correct Way to Handle “All Sectors” in Schema
Homepage:

Organization

WebSite

FAQPage

EmploymentAgency

BreadcrumbList

Category Pages:

CollectionPage

ItemList (UN Jobs, Tech Jobs, Finance Jobs, etc.)

Individual Job Pages:

JobPosting (single job only)

👉 This is how Indeed, LinkedIn, Devex do it.

✅ 6️⃣ Does Your New SEO Accurately Represent the Site?
✅ YES — conceptually correct

You are now positioned as:

🌍 International

🏛 UN & NGO

💻 Technology

💰 Finance

🏥 Healthcare

🛠 Engineering

📊 Consulting

🌐 All regions

⚠️ BUT Google will only trust this if:

You publish real content for each sector

You create dedicated category pages

You avoid brand name overuse

You follow schema rules strictly

✅ 7️⃣ Final Verdict (Honest & Professional)

Your direction is right.
With 2–3 refinements, this becomes enterprise-level SEO.

✅ What to adjust now:

Shorten title (most important)

Remove brand stuffing from meta description

Use sector-based keywords, not company names

Ensure JobPosting schema is only on job pages
