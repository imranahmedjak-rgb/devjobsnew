Please implement the following features ONLY for jobs posted directly on Dev Global Jobs.
These requirements do NOT apply to jobs imported via APIs or external sources.

1️⃣ Job Posting Form (Direct Posts Only)
A. Mandatory Job Categories

For directly posted jobs, add a required category field with the following options:

UN Jobs

NGO Jobs

International Jobs

(Category selection is mandatory before submission.)

B. Application Method (Direct Posts Only)

Add two mandatory application options (radio buttons):

Apply via Link

Recruiter provides an external application URL

Users clicking “Apply” are redirected to the external site

Apply via Email

Recruiter provides an email address

Applications are sent directly via email

(Recruiter must select one option.)

2️⃣ Recruiter Authentication (Direct Job Posting Only)

Recruiter must sign up with email

Email verification required

Recruiter must log in before posting a job

Guest job posting must NOT be allowed

3️⃣ Recruiter Profile (Required for Direct Posting)

Before posting a job, recruiter must complete a simple profile:

Organization / Company name

Contact email

Country

Short organization description

(Profile completion required only once.)

4️⃣ Job Seeker Profile (Optional – Platform Feature)

Users may:

Sign up with email

Log in and create a simple profile:

Name

Country

Experience

Expertise

CV upload (PDF / DOC)

(This applies platform-wide, not only to direct jobs.)

5️⃣ Application Logic (Direct Jobs Only)

If job uses Apply via Email:

Applications go directly to recruiter email

If job uses Apply via Link:

Users are redirected to the provided URL

(No internal application tracking needed at this stage.)

6️⃣ Navigation & Access Control

Post a Job → Redirect to signup/login if recruiter is not authenticated

Profile → Redirect to signup/login if user is not authenticated

Main navigation should include:

193 Countries

Refresh Feed

Post a Job

User Profile

7️⃣ Important Clarification (VERY IMPORTANT)

⚠️ All above rules apply ONLY to jobs posted directly on Dev Global Jobs.

API-imported jobs:

Do NOT require recruiter signup

Do NOT use job posting form

Do NOT require category or apply method selection

Keep original source & apply link/email

8️⃣ Additional Best Practices (Recommended)

Prevent duplicate direct job postings

Display job source clearly:

“Direct – Dev Global Jobs”

“Source: Lever / Greenhouse / API”

Show “Posted X days ago”

Enable job sharing buttons

✅ Objective

Keep the platform:

Professional

Simple

Trustworthy

Scalable for future monetization
